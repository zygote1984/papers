\section{Instance Pointcuts}

Instance pointcut is a declarative language construct that is used to reify and maintain a set of objects of a specific type, with the ability to select them over a period marked by events in their life-cycle, modularizing the object selection concern. The purpose of instance pointcuts is to  let the user to make focused selections, therefore offering a different level of modularity. 
 
In the remainder of this section, we will explain instance pointcuts in detail. We have implemented a prototype by extending AspectJ, throughout the section code examples of instance pointcuts will be in AspectJ.

%\missingfigure{Static Structure of instance pointcuts}

\subsection{Features}

A concrete instance pointcut definition consists of a left hand-side and a right-hand side. 
In the left hand side the pointcut's name and the instance type of interest is declared. 
Unlike AspectJ pointcuts, instance pointcuts cannot declare pointcut parameters, it only has a single implicit parameter called \texttt{instance} of the declared instance type. 
In the right hand side a pointcut expression describes the desired join-points and then binds the exposed object as a member of the instance pointcut's set, which is represented by the variable \texttt{instance}. 
It is also possible to declare an abstract instance pointcut, by leaving out the right hand side and placing the \emph{abstract} modifier at the beginning of the declaration.


\subsubsection{Add/Remove Expressions}
Join points mark \emph{sites} of execution; a join-point by itself does not define an event. 
In AspectJ pointcuts, pointcut expressions select joinpoints and pointcuts are used with advice specifications to select a particular event in that join-point.
Instance pointcuts are not used with advices; since they serve the specific purpose of reifying and maintaining object sets, they implicitly have advice bodies. 
Therefore instance pointcut expression are used to select specific events rather than joinpoints.
To be able to define events with instance pointcut expressions, it is necessary to use advice specification clauses \texttt{before} or \texttt{after} in the expression. 

The \emph{add expression} which exposes the instances to be added to the instance pointcut set, selects the event which marks the beginning of the life-cycle phase of interest. 
Instance pointcuts can also include an optional \texttt{remove expression},  which exposes the instances to be removed from the set, selects the event which marks the end of the life-cycle phase of interest.
 Both add and remove expressions contains at least one \emph{event} definition at at most two; the \emph{before event} and \texttt{after event}. The grammar definition below shows part of the instance pointcut syntax. 
An event definition is comprised of an event keyword , \texttt{before} or \texttt{after}, and a pointcut expression.
The pointcut expression selects a set of join points and the event keyword specifies which event is selected from a join-point. 
In an instance pointcut expression, it is only possible to \texttt{OR} a before event with an after event. 
The reason for this is, the \texttt{AND} operation will result in an empty set, since a before and an after events are separate.

\begin{grammar}
<instance pointcut> ::= `instace pointcut' <name> `<' <instanceType> `>' `=' (ip-expr-2 (`||' \alt `&&'))? <ip-expr> (`UNTIL' <ip-expr>)? 

<ip-expr-2> ::== <ip-ref> \alt <ip-expr-2> `&&' <ip-expr-2> \alt <ip-expr-2> `||' <ip-expr-2>

<ip-expr> ::= <after-event> `||' <before-event> \alt <before-event> `||' <after-event> \alt <after-event> \alt <before-event>

<after-event> ::= `after' `('<pointcut-expression>`)'

<before-event> ::= `before' `('<pointcut-expression>`)'
\end{grammar}


\begin{lstlisting}[float=h!, caption={A basic instance pointcut declaration with add and remove expressions}, label={lst:basic}]
instance pointcut customers<Customer>: after(call(SessionManager.createCustomer(..)) && returning(instance)) UNTIL before(call(SessionManager.destroyCustomer(..)) && args(instance))
\end{lstlisting}

The instance pointcut in Listing \ref{lst:basic} shows a basic example. The left-hand side of the instance pointcut indicates the pointcut is called \texttt{customers} and it is interested in selecting the \texttt{Customer} objects. 
On the right hand side, there are two expression separated by the \texttt{UNTIL} keyword. The first one is the add expression. It selects the return event of the method \texttt{createCustomer} and from the context of this event it exposes the returned \texttt{Customer} object with the \texttt{returning} clause and binds it to the \texttt{instance} parameter. If the \texttt{instance} parameter is bounded by the returning clause then it has to be in an after event. The second one is the remove expression and it selects the before event \texttt{destroyCustomer} call and exposes the \texttt{Customer} instance in the method arguments and binds it to the \texttt{instance} parameter with \texttt{args} pointcut.

\emph{Note that instance pointcuts do not keep objects alive.} Because instance pointcuts are non-invasive constructs, which do not affect the program execution in any way. So even if the remove expression was not defined for \texttt{customers} pointcut, if the \texttt{Customer} instances were collected by the garbage collector, they would still be removed from the set. 


\subsubsection{Multiset Support}
Instance pointcuts provide the option to use sets or multisets. Sets are restricted since they can only contain an element once, multisets how ever can contain duplicates of an element. By default the following expression \lstinline!instance pointcut {pc_name}<{instance_type}>! means that the instance pointcut is a set. The multiset option can be chosen via putting \texttt{*} after instance type; \lstinline!instance pointcut {pc_name}<{instance_type*}>!.

Multisets are used when the same object is added to the set multiple times and there should be book-keeping of the duplicates. The examples in Listing \ref{lst:wishlisted} shows two situations one using a set and another using a multiset. The add expression of \texttt{products1} selects the products which are added to a customer's wish-list and which are currently out of stock, until a \texttt{Vendor} stocks up that product again then the product is removed from the set. In this case we use a set because we are not interested in the duplicates of \texttt{Product} instances, we are only interested if a \texttt{Product} is wish-listed when it was out of stock. The second instance pointcut also selects \texttt{Product} instances, this time without checking the availability. The remove expression removes a \texttt{Product} instance if it is removed from the wish-list of a \texttt{Customer}. With this pointcut we would like to count the currently wish-listed products. If we use a set then as soon as a customer removes a product from his wish-list, its only copy will be removed and it will appear removed from all customers' wish-lists, therefore a multi-set is used. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float=h!, caption={Two instance pointcuts, each maintains a set of wish-listed products}, label={lst:wishlisted}]
instance pointcut products1<Product>: 
before(call(Customer.addToWishList(..)) && args(instance) && if(!instance.inStock())) 
	UNTIL after(call(Vendor.stock(..)) && args(instance))
instance pointcut products2<Product*>: 
before(call(Customer.addToWishList(..)) && args(instance))
 UNTIL before(call(Customer.removeFromWishList(..)) && args(instance))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Set Monitoring}
An instance pointcuts definition also defines two set change events; add event and remove event. These events are interesting since they signify that the object has become relevant or irrelevant.

\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Referencing Instance Pointcuts}
Normally instance pointcuts are referenced by their name, however they can also take an additional statement for \emph{type refinement}, which selects a subset of the instance pointcut dynamically. Type refinements require that, the refined type is a subtype of the original instance type. For example the instance pointcut \texttt{products} can be refined with the following syntax: \lstinline!products<BeautyProduct>!. 
This indicates we would like to select the subset of \texttt{BeautyProduct} instances from the set of \texttt{Product} instances selected by \texttt{products}. 
Note that this notation will also select subtypes of \texttt{BeautyProduct}. 
If this is not the desired effect then the following: \lstinline!instance pointcut beautyProducts<BeautyProduct>: products && if(instance.getClass().equals(BeautyProduct.class))! can be used. 
The effect of a refinement subset being empty is equivalent to that of an unmatched pointcut.

%\subsection{Refinement} 
%It is possible to refine instance pointcuts in multiple ways. Normally instance pointcuts are referenced by their name, however they can also take an additional statement for \emph{type refinement}, which selects a subset of the instance pointcut dynamically. Type refinements require that, the refined type is a subtype of the original instance type. For example the instance pointcut \texttt{customers} can be refined with the following syntax: \lstinline!customers<GoldCustomer>!. 
%This indicates we would like to select the subset of \texttt{GoldCustomer} instances from the set of \texttt{Customer} instances selected by \texttt{customers}. 
%Note that this notation will also select subtypes of \texttt{GoldCustomer}. 
%If this is not the desired effect then the following: \lstinline!instance pointcut goldCustomers<GoldCustomer>: customers && if(instance.getClass().equals(GoldCustomer.class))! can be used. 
%The effect of a refinement subset being empty is equivalent to that of an unmatched pointcut. 
%Note that if the \textbf{+} operator was not used in the pointcut expression, the refinement expression would still be legal, since \texttt{Rectangle} is a subtype of \texttt{Shape}. However it would result in a warning explaining the \texttt{Shape}'s subtypes are not selected.

Instance pointcuts can also be refined inside a pointcut expressions and the refinement result will then be assigned to the instance pointcut on the left-hand side. Once again refining the \texttt{customers} pointcut, we can define the following:

%\begin{lstlisting}[float=h!]
%instance pointcut goldCustomers<GoldCustomer>: customers &&  after(if(instance.getGoldCustomerID().startsWith(``NL'')))



%instance pointcut goldCustomersNL<GoldCustomer>: after(if(instance.getGoldCustomerID().startsWith(``NL'')))
%                                                 customer[] INTERSECT goldCoustomerNL[]
%\end{lstlisting}


The \texttt{goldCustomers} instance pointcut is interested in \texttt{GoldCustomer} objects which are selected by \texttt{customers} and who have \texttt{goldCustomerID}s starting with the string ``NL''. The pointcut expression to select these instances is very concise and is shown in the listing above. \texttt{customers<GoldCustomer>} statement selects the \texttt{GoldCustomer} instances selected by \texttt{customers} pointcut, then the \texttt{if} pointcuts checks whether these instances satisfy the condition. Note that the following statement; \lstinline!instance pointcut regularCustomers<RegularCustomer>: customers<GoldCustomer> &&  if(instance.getGoldCustomerID().startsWith(``NL''))! , would result in a compile error for two reasons. First we cannot assign \texttt{GoldCustomer} instances to a \texttt{RegularCustomer} instance pointcut. Secondly \texttt{instance.getGoldCustomerID()} is illegal since \texttt{instance} is the implicit variable of the \texttt{regularCustomers} pointcut and it has the type \texttt{RegularCustomer}, which does not have the property \texttt{goldCustomerID}.

Refinement mechanisms provide a consistent selection process and reduce redundancy. Being able to select subsets of instance pointcuts, eliminates the need for defining separate pointcuts for subsets, which may result in erroneous selections. Since the refinement only supports the subtypes of the original instance type, it works with the system's type hierarchy in a natural manner. 


\subsection{Compilation of Instance Pointcuts}

Instance pointcuts are implemented as an extension to AspectJ, they reuse AspectJ pointcut expressions, however they also allow \texttt{returning} clause in the pointcut expression to capture returned objects. In Figure \ref{fig:ip} static structure of this extension is shown. Both \texttt{InstancePointcut} and \texttt{AspectJPointcut} inherit from the \texttt{Pointcut} abstract class. As seen on the diagram, instance pointcuts can have two pointcut expressions, one is inherited from \texttt{Pointcut} and is called \texttt{exp}. This attribute is also inherited by the AspectJ pointcut. The second one is however specific to instance pointcuts (\texttt{removeExp}) and it can be used to define pointcut expressions for deselecting instances(Section \ref{sec:deselect}). Note that the \texttt{PointcutExpression} class is a subtype of \texttt{ConditionalExpression} \textbf{\textcolor[rgb]{1,0.41,0.13}{(Mention JaMoPP)}}. Another notable difference between AspectJ and instance pointcuts is that AspectJ pointcuts are parametrizable (\texttt{Parametrizable} interface), while instance pointcuts have a single implicit parameter called \emph{instance}. The type of this parameter is stored in the mandatory attribute \texttt{instanceType}.

Instance pointcuts can be compiled to various AO-languages, for our prototype we chose AspectJ as the target language. A pseudo-code of the generator template for instance pointcuts is shown in Listing \ref{lst:ip2aj}.

		%'Set<'pc.instanceType'>' pc.name'_set'
	%}
	%else{
		%'Set<'pc.instanceType'>' pc.name'_set = new TreeSet<'pc.instanceType'>();'
		%generateAspectJCode(pc, SELECT);
		%if(pc.removeExpression != null)
			%generateAspectJCode(pc, REMOVE);
  %}
%}	
%generateAspectJCode(InstancePointcut pc, ExpressionType eType){
	%String pcname, setOperation, setName = pc.name + '_set';
	%PointcutExpression expTemp;
	%switch(eType){
		%case REMOVE:{
			%pcname = pc.name + '_remove';
			%setOperation = 'remove';
			%expTemp = pc.removeExp;

		%case SELECT:{
			%pcname = pc.name;
			%setOperation = 'add';
			%expTemp = pc.exp;
		%}
	%}	
	%if(exp.contains(ReturningStatement))	{
		 %PointcutExpression newExp = expTemp.remove(ReturningStatement);	
		%'pointcut' pcname'():' print(newExp) ';'
		%'after() returning(' instanceType 'instance):' pcname'(){'		
	%}
	%else{
		%'pointcut' pcname'('pc.instanceType 'instance):' print(expTemp) ';'

	%}
	%'boolean flag ='setName.setOperation '(instance);

	%}'

	%\item When products are added to GoldCustomer’s shopping bags, apply an additional discount
	%\item When a product is marked low selling by the system, put an advertisement for it on the sidebar → refinement low selling books...,

	%\item composition:intersect(low selling products && products from Vendor A && products which are lipsticks)
	%\item When it is added to a shopping bag its price may be decreased by applying a discount policy. These examples contain an initial event that is associated with a particular instance, which triggers a follow-up event.

%\subsection{Explanation of features, just a summary}
%Selecting a set of objects based on their life-cycle events provide a new dimension in categorizing objects. Instance pointcuts reify such a set, by offering a declarative syntax for adding objects to it. The object to be added is exposed in the context of the matched event. An object might only be relevant during a particular phase of its life-cycle, which is marked by certain events. Then it is necessary to have a mechanism to remove objects from the set once the event that marks the end of that phase is encountered. Hence, it is possible to declare an optional removal expression in an instance pointcut.
%
%Instance pointcuts represent a set, and the objects in this set can be accessed through instance pointcuts. Also when there's a change in the set, i.e. an object is added or removed, it is  possible for the interested modules to access the change events. 
%
%Sets can have subsets or supersets. This is also true for the sets of objects created by instance pointcuts. An instance pointcut can be refined to obtain the subset of objects it originally selected or it can be a subset of another instance pointcut which broadens its scope. This refinement mechanism makes instance pointcuts reusable. Composition is also supported via the ability to perform set operations on instance pointcuts. It is possible to define intersection or union of two instance pointcuts, in order to define a new one. 
%
%The various features instance pointcuts offer also require some checking to be performed. For example when refining a pointcut to obtain a subset, we may end up with an empty set. This situation should be checked and necessary warning should be given. Since instance pointcuts dedicated to a type, the composition operations may fail if the composed pointcuts do not select co-variant types, which should also be checked.
