resuable integration modules can be

- an atomic adapter that adapts objects which's properties are primitive types.

- aggregators and splitters


currently adapters are monolithic structures which encapsulate the "ugly" adaptation code between two objects. Adapting composite objects usually require adapting the composing objects individually then aggregating these adapted objects into a new object. This is the case when there is a one to one structural correspondance between the input interface and the output interface of the adapter. 

can we find the reverse adapter of an adapter by using static analysis?

		-there is no loss of data, for example if an adapter combines some data taken from the adaptee to create a new one and in the process the original data becomes unrecoverable, we cannot create a reverse adapter. 


aggregators can also be used for splitting.
