 One of the major challenges is the fine-grained extensions. They present their tool called Colored IDE to support granularity in SPLs.
 SPL implementation approaches are divided into two groups, compositional approach and annotative approach which both has their limitations. 
 Authors talk about the problem of coarse granularity and the difficulty of fine-grained extention support. They stress the limitations of programming languages
 and present their approach on decomposing legacy applications into features that may have fine granularity. Instead of using annotations authors use colors to associate features with 
 code. They use a preprocessor like approach to decompose the source code in an Abstract Syntac Tree, and allow the user to make fine grained changes to the code. "

The authors employ an architectural approach because they forsee AFMs can evolve with further research in FOP and AOP. An in-language approach would be too expensive to modify. 
In AFM aspects are encapsulated in feature modules. In conclusion; dominant role of features is the introduction of new structural elements, aspects lead to reduction in the amount of code and cleaner design and implementation.  "

   product line engineering. DSLs are around for a long time now, but the methods for systematic development of DSLs are 
   more recent. A key concept in generative software development is the mapping between problem and solution spaces, which is also referred
   to as generative domain model. There are two views of this mapping, configuration and transformational. In configurational mapping problem space is used to 
   express requirements and solution space consists of composable components, which can be composed to form a system, which statisfies the requirements. In the transformational approach the problem 
   space is represente dby a DSL and the solution space is its implementation.The author also talks about feature modeling and categorizes the features in to four groups: concrete, aspectual, abstract 
   and grouping. The feature model scope also determines the DSL scope. It is the starting point of the software development for prodcut lines. 
   In conclusion author repeats his opinions ons DSLs and feature modeling,
   he also makes positive remarks on using aspect orientation for better separation of concerns and composition.

   The approach is presented in the form of a tutorial. 
   They use Logic truth maintenance systems(LTMS) and satisfiability solvers to debug feature models.
   Using feature models tree grammars are derived. The author notes feature models are generally nor context free grammars and there 
   may be additional constraints regarding the compatiblity of features. The paper continues to explain the usage of LTMS in feature modeling
   context and explains Boolean Constraint Propogation algorithm. 
   Guidsl tool is presented and explained with a graph product line example.
   Author states that debugging feature models is very difficult, by equating feature models with propositional formulas, the task of debugging is substatially simplified.
   The benefits of LTMS is limited. 
   But using such techniques together certainly simplifies the testing and debugging process.   "
